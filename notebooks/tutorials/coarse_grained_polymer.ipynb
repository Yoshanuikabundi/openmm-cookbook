    "# Coarse-Grained Polymer\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will give a basic example of creating a custom coarse-grained model in OpenMM. It demonstrates how to create a custom forcefield xml file and how to create a molecular topology from scratch using the OpenMM python API.\n",
    "It assumes you are familiar with the concept of coarse-graining and want to learn how to implement your CG model in OpenMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example System\n",
    "The example system in this tutorial is a Lennard-Jones bead-spring polymer model. We will demonstrate how to create a polymer melt of multiple chains. Note that we will set the bond lengths, particle mass, and Lennard-Jones interaction parameters to physical values that are typical of a residue level coarse-grained protein model (e.g. [xxx]).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the force-field file\n",

    "# Umbrella Sampling\n",

    "\n",
    "## Umbrella sampling simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Most umbrella sampling simulations have three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preparing the windows, this is usually done using steered MD.\n",
    "2. Running the windows, these can be run in parallel.\n",
    "3. Analysing the results, typically this involves computing a PMF with WHAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you will find in step 3 that the simulations do not produce a nicely converged PMF. You will need to go back to steps 1 and 2 and change some settings, this trial and improvement feedback loop is a normal part of the process. For this tutorial we will use settings already known to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will use umbrella sampling to compute the free energy profile of the end to end distance of deca-alanine in vacuum. Deca-aline is commonly used as a toy system [1], its equilibrium structure is a stable alpha-helix. we will start with the alpha-helix structure, as used in [1], perform a steered MD simulation to pull it from helix into a coil, and then run umbrella sampling windows to compute the free energy profile along the collective variable, which is the distance between the first and last alpha-carbon.\n",

    "## Step 1 - setting up the windows with SMD\n",
    "\n",
    "The script below does the following steps:\n",
    "-   loads in a PDB file\n",
    "-   Defines a collective variable between the first and last alpha-carbon\n",
    "-   Adds a harmonic restraint to the CV\n",
    "-   Runs a simulation where the location of the harmonic restraint is moved with constant velocity from 1.3nm to 3.5nm (This is called constant velocity steered MD).\n",
    "-   Saves a configuration for each of the 24 equally spaced windows we have defined."
